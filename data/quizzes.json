    "question": "Explain how Proof-of-Work introduces physical constraints into cyberspace and why this matters for national security.",
    "correctAnswer": "PoW requires real energy expenditure and hardware investment that cannot be replicated without equivalent costs. This matters for national security because it enables deterrence mechanisms, creates measurable defensive capabilities (hash rate), and allows traditional strategic frameworks to apply in the cyber domain.",
    "explanation": "This question tests understanding of the bridge between physical and cyber domains, and the strategic implications of imposing real-world costs on digital operations.",

    "correctAnswer": "1) Recognize Bitcoin as strategic technology—nations that understand it gain competitive advantages. 2) Invest in domestic hash rate capacity—this builds defensive cyber capabilities and prevents adversary dominance in PoW-based power projection.",

    "correctAnswer": "Gunpowder: Made defensive fortifications vulnerable, democratized offensive power. Nuclear: Created ultimate deterrence through MAD, required massive investment. Bitcoin parallel: Introduces physical costs in cyber domain, enables deterrence, creates competitive dynamics in hash rate accumulation. All three represent transformative technologies requiring new strategic doctrines.",

    "correctAnswer": "The physical cost gap: Traditional cyber operations lack physical constraints—code copies infinitely at near-zero cost, making deterrence difficult.
