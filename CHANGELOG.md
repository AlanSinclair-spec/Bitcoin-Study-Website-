## What Still Needs Work

⚠️ **Tailwind CSS v4 Build Issue**: The build process has a PostCSS configuration conflict with Tailwind v4. Dev mode works (`npm run dev`), but production build needs configuration fix. This is a configuration issue, not a code problem.

⏳ **Not Yet Implemented** (from original scope):
- Glossary doesn't yet include Fundamentals terms (currently only Softwar terms)
- Flashcard filters (All/Softwar/Fundamentals/Chapter/Focus) not added
- "Reflect in Journal" prefill from lesson pages not wired up
- Weak-area detection computes but doesn't yet display on dashboard
- Sample journal entry not created
- Mobile UI improvements (swipe navigation, bottom nav) not added
- Dark/light mode not tested visually

## Files Changed
- Created: 5 new Softwar chapter files (ch2-ch6 + conclusion)
- Updated: flashcards.json (40 Softwar cards)
- Updated: quizzes.json (45 Softwar questions)
- Created: /lib/progress/storage.ts (progress tracking)
- Created: /components/progress-tracker.tsx (UI components)
- Created: /app/journal/[id]/page.tsx (entry detail)
- Created: /app/journal/settings/page.tsx (settings & export)
- Updated: /app/page.tsx (homepage with checklist + progress)
- Created: /components/ui/input.tsx
- Created: /components/ui/textarea.tsx
- Updated: postcss.config.js (Tailwind v4 compatibility)
- Updated: /app/globals.css (Tailwind v4 import syntax)

## Migration Notes

**If starting fresh**:
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Visit http://localhost:3000
4. Start with Fundamentals Lesson 1 or Softwar Executive Summary
5. Mark lessons complete as you finish them
6. Create journal entries to reflect on learning
7. Export your journal regularly for backup

**Data Persistence**:
- All progress stored in browser localStorage
- Journal entries persist across sessions
- Clear browser data = lose all progress (export before clearing!)
- No server/database required (privacy-first design)
