# Chapter 2: Methodology

## Overview

This chapter outlines the research methodology employed in developing the Softwar thesis. The author uses **Grounded Theory**, a qualitative research method that builds theories from systematic data collection and analysis rather than testing pre-existing hypotheses.

## 2.1 Four Reasons for Grounded Theory

Lowery chose Grounded Theory for four compelling reasons:

1. **Complexity of the Problem**: Bitcoin's strategic significance spans multiple disciplines (computer science, military strategy, economics, philosophy), making traditional hypothesis-testing insufficient.

2. **Lack of Existing Framework**: No existing academic framework adequately explained Bitcoin's role in national security and power projection.

3. **Interdisciplinary Nature**: The research required synthesizing insights from biology, history, computer science, and military theory—domains that rarely intersect in academic literature.

4. **Exploratory Goals**: The objective wasn't to prove a predetermined thesis but to discover what Bitcoin fundamentally *is* from a strategic perspective.

<KeyTakeaway>
**Why Grounded Theory?** When exploring completely new territory where existing academic frameworks fall short, Grounded Theory allows researchers to build explanations from observed patterns rather than forcing data into pre-existing models.
</KeyTakeaway>

## 2.2 Overview

Grounded Theory involves:

- **Iterative data collection**: Gathering information from diverse sources
- **Constant comparison**: Comparing new data with emerging patterns
- **Theoretical sampling**: Seeking out new data specifically to test emerging theories
- **Coding and categorization**: Systematically organizing observations into concepts and categories
- **Theory emergence**: Allowing explanatory frameworks to emerge organically from data

This approach is particularly suited to understanding novel phenomena like Bitcoin that don't fit neatly into traditional academic categories.

## 2.3 Process

The research process followed these phases:

### Phase 1: Open Coding
- Read widely across computer science, military history, biology, and philosophy
- Identified recurring themes and concepts
- Noted anomalies and contradictions in existing Bitcoin literature

### Phase 2: Axial Coding
- Organized concepts into broader categories
- Identified relationships between categories
- Began forming preliminary theoretical connections

### Phase 3: Selective Coding
- Focused on core categories: **Power Projection**, **Physical Cost**, **Resource Control**
- Integrated disparate concepts into a unified framework
- Developed the central theoretical argument

### Phase 4: Theoretical Saturation
- Continued research until new data no longer significantly altered the emerging theory
- Validated findings across multiple domains

**Figure 4** (referenced in the thesis) illustrates these four phases as an iterative cycle rather than a linear progression.

<KeyTakeaway>
**The Research Loop**: Grounded Theory isn't a straight line from question to answer. It's a spiral where each pass through the data refines and deepens the emerging theory.
</KeyTakeaway>

## 2.4 Disadvantages & Advantages

### Disadvantages

**Time-Intensive**: Grounded Theory requires extensive reading, re-reading, and iterative analysis. Lowery spent years immersed in diverse literatures.

**Subjectivity Risk**: Because the researcher is the primary instrument of analysis, personal biases can creep in. Lowery mitigates this through transparent reasoning and extensive cross-referencing.

**Difficulty Replicating**: Unlike experiments with controlled variables, Grounded Theory produces unique insights shaped by the researcher's perspective and data sources.

**Academic Skepticism**: Some traditional academics view Grounded Theory as less rigorous than quantitative methods.

### Advantages

**Discovery of Novel Insights**: Enabled Lowery to see connections between Bitcoin, antler displays in nature, and nuclear deterrence—connections invisible through traditional lenses.

**Flexibility**: Allowed pursuit of unexpected leads (e.g., exploring animal behavior to understand human warfighting).

**Holistic Understanding**: Integrated technical, strategic, biological, and philosophical dimensions into a coherent framework.

**Practical Relevance**: Produced actionable policy recommendations grounded in systematic analysis.

## 2.5 Lessons Learned

Key takeaways from applying Grounded Theory to Bitcoin research:

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Initially cast a wide net across disciplines, then focus on core categories as patterns emerge.

2. **Embrace Confusion**: Periods of conceptual chaos are normal and productive. The theory crystallizes gradually.

3. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed notes on emerging connections, even if they seem tangential. Patterns reveal themselves over time.

4. **Challenge Your Assumptions**: Actively seek data that contradicts your emerging theory. If it survives such tests, it's stronger.

5. **Trust the Process**: Resist the urge to force a conclusion prematurely. Let the theory emerge organically.

<EverydayApplication>
**For Your Learning**: As you study this thesis, adopt a similar mindset. Don't rush to judgment on whether Bitcoin is "good" or "bad," "currency" or "asset." Instead, follow the evidence and let your understanding evolve as you progress through the chapters.
</EverydayApplication>

## Methodological Rigor

Despite its qualitative nature, Lowery's research maintains rigor through:

- **Transparent Reasoning**: Each claim is backed by specific evidence and clear logic
- **Cross-Domain Validation**: Theories are tested against examples from biology, history, and computer science
- **Peer Review**: The thesis underwent MIT faculty review and Air Force institutional scrutiny
- **Practical Testing**: Recommendations are grounded in real-world feasibility

## How This Shapes the Thesis

Understanding the methodology helps you interpret the rest of the thesis:

- **Expect Interdisciplinary Leaps**: The argument draws from unexpected sources (animal behavior, ancient history, cryptography)
- **Look for Patterns**: Recurring themes (physical cost, deterrence, resource control) unify seemingly disparate topics
- **Appreciate the Journey**: The thesis reconstructs Lowery's intellectual journey, inviting you to re-trace his reasoning

<KeyTakeaway>
**The Method IS the Message**: Lowery's willingness to question fundamental assumptions about Bitcoin—to ask "What if we've been categorizing it wrong all along?"—is itself a lesson in critical thinking and intellectual courage.
</KeyTakeaway>

## Policy Implications

The methodological choice has policy consequences:

- **Avoid Premature Categorization**: Labeling Bitcoin as "cryptocurrency" before understanding its strategic function risks missing its true significance
- **Encourage Interdisciplinary Analysis**: National security assessments of emerging technologies should involve diverse expertise (military strategists, computer scientists, historians)
- **Value Exploratory Research**: Not every research question can be answered through controlled experiments. Sometimes discovering the right questions is more important than testing predetermined hypotheses.

## Reflection Prompts

1. How does the research method shape the credibility of the findings? Would a different method (e.g., controlled experiments) have produced better results?

2. What are the risks of using Grounded Theory for national security research? What are the risks of *not* using it?

3. If you were advising a policymaker on Bitcoin, would you recommend they read this thesis differently knowing it's based on Grounded Theory?

## Compare to Softwar

**Research Method as Strategy**: Just as grounded theory requires patience and iterative refinement, effective national security strategy requires willingness to revise assumptions when evidence contradicts them. Rigid adherence to outdated frameworks can be strategically dangerous.
