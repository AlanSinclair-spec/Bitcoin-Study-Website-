# Chapter 6: Recommendations & Conclusion

## Overview

This final chapter synthesizes the Softwar thesis into actionable policy recommendations and concluding thoughts. Lowery addresses military leaders, policymakers, and citizens, urging them to recognize Bitcoin's strategic significance before geopolitical competitors gain irreversible advantages.

## 6.1 Key Takeaways

### Core Thesis Summary

**The Complete Argument**:

1. **Nature's Template** (Ch. 3): All organisms secure resources by imposing physical costs on competitors. Evolution favors costly signals (like antlers) that deter conflict without fighting.

2. **Human Adaptation** (Ch. 4): Humans added abstract power (laws, money, social status) to physical power, enabling large-scale cooperation but also creating exploitable belief systems.

3. **Cyber Vulnerability** (Ch. 5): Digital resources were previously secured only by abstract means (passwords, permissions), making them vulnerable to administrators and hackers.

4. **Bitcoin's Innovation** (Ch. 5): Proof-of-Work enables physical power projection in cyberspace—the first technology to anchor digital property rights to unforgeable physical cost.

5. **Strategic Implications** (Ch. 6): Nations that recognize Bitcoin as a strategic technology (like nuclear weapons or GPS) will gain advantages in cyber security, economic sovereignty, and global power projection.

<KeyTakeaway>
**One-Sentence Thesis**: Bitcoin is not primarily a currency; it's a non-lethal cyber power projection technology that could transform national security in the digital age.
</KeyTakeaway>

### Why This Matters

**Three Critical Points**:

1. **Cyberspace is a Strategic Domain**: Like land, sea, air, and space, cyberspace requires military consideration. Bitcoin provides the first effective means of physically securing digital resources.

2. **Speed of Adoption Matters**: Network effects and first-mover advantages mean early adopters gain disproportionate strategic benefits. Waiting for "perfect understanding" risks strategic loss.

3. **Mischaracterization Is Dangerous**: Calling Bitcoin "cryptocurrency" and allowing financial regulators to lead policy is like letting accountants manage nuclear weapons strategy. It's a category error with national security consequences.

## 6.2 Recommendations for Future Research

### For Computer Scientists

**Research Priority 1**: Explore applications of proof-of-work beyond currency.

**Questions**:
- Can proof-of-work secure DNS (domain names)?
- Can it prevent distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks?
- Can it create unforgeable digital identities?

**Research Priority 2**: Improve energy efficiency without sacrificing security.

**Questions**:
- Can hash algorithms be optimized?
- Can renewable energy integration reduce environmental concerns?
- What is the theoretical minimum energy cost for adequate security?

### For Military Strategists

**Research Priority 1**: Develop doctrines for cyber power projection using proof-of-work.

**Questions**:
- How should militaries incorporate hash rate into threat assessments?
- What are the strategic implications of nation-state mining operations?
- Can proof-of-work protocols defend critical infrastructure?

**Research Priority 2**: Model game theory of nation-state Bitcoin competition.

**Questions**:
- Is a Bitcoin arms race stabilizing or destabilizing?
- How does Bitcoin accumulation affect nuclear deterrence dynamics?
- What are the strategic implications of one nation controlling >50% of hash power?

### For Economists

**Research Priority 1**: Study macroeconomic effects of Bitcoin adoption.

**Questions**:
- How does a 21-million fixed supply affect monetary policy?
- What happens to fiat currencies as Bitcoin gains reserve status?
- Does Bitcoin increase or decrease financial stability?

**Research Priority 2**: Model energy market impacts of large-scale mining.

**Questions**:
- How does Bitcoin mining affect electricity prices?
- Does mining incentivize or disincentivize renewable energy development?
- What are the geopolitical implications of mining concentration?

## 6.3 Recommendations for Future Policy Making Efforts

### For the United States Government

**Recommendation 1: Establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve**

**Rationale**:
- Early accumulation gains maximum strategic advantage
- Demonstrates commitment to decentralized cyber security
- Provides hedge against competitors' accumulation
- Signals to markets that the US takes Bitcoin seriously

**Action**:
- Allocate portion of Treasury reserves to Bitcoin
- Establish criteria for accumulation (price targets, timeframes)
- Create transparent reporting mechanisms

**Risks of Inaction**:
- Russia, China, or other competitors accumulate majority supply
- US loses strategic leverage in cyber domain
- Dollar hegemony erodes faster as alternative reserve asset gains legitimacy

---

**Recommendation 2: Protect Domestic Hash Power**

**Rationale**:
- Hash power is strategic infrastructure (like oil refineries or semiconductor fabs)
- Dependence on foreign mining creates vulnerability
- Cheap domestic energy enables competitive mining

**Action**:
- Classify Bitcoin mining as critical infrastructure
- Provide incentives for domestic mining operations
- Ensure energy grid can support strategic mining capacity
- Establish mining operations in military installations for guaranteed security

**Risks of Inaction**:
- Majority of hash power concentrates in adversary nations
- US becomes dependent on foreign powers for digital security
- Potential for 51% attack coordinated by hostile actors

---

**Recommendation 3: Educate Military and Policy Leaders**

**Rationale**:
- Current categorization of Bitcoin as "cryptocurrency" reflects fundamental misunderstanding
- Effective policy requires understanding proof-of-work's strategic significance
- Institutional knowledge gap creates vulnerability to misinformation

**Action**:
- Integrate Bitcoin/proof-of-work education into military academies
- Create briefings for Congressional leaders
- Establish research centers focused on cyber power projection
- Fund academic positions in Bitcoin strategic studies

**Risks of Inaction**:
- Policymakers continue making strategic decisions based on incomplete understanding
- Special interests exploit knowledge gaps for regulatory capture
- US strategic doctrine falls behind reality

---

**Recommendation 4: Develop International Norms for Cyber Power Projection**

**Rationale**:
- Just as treaties govern nuclear weapons, norms should govern hash power
- Early norm-setting gives first movers influence over rules
- Preventing escalation requires mutual understanding

**Action**:
- Convene international working groups on proof-of-work governance
- Establish transparency standards for nation-state mining operations
- Create frameworks for responding to hash power concentration
- Develop analog to nuclear non-proliferation for cyber power

**Risks of Inaction**:
- Adversaries set international norms favorable to their interests
- Hash power arms race proceeds without guardrails
- Increased risk of cyber conflict due to misunderstanding intentions

---

**Recommendation 5: Reform Regulatory Approach**

**Rationale**:
- Current regulatory framework treats Bitcoin as financial asset
- Strategic technologies require different regulatory approach (cf. nuclear, aerospace)
- Financial regulators lack expertise in military strategy and cyber security

**Action**:
- Transfer primary regulatory authority to Department of Defense / NSA / Cyber Command
- Consult financial regulators on monetary aspects, but not strategic aspects
- Create new regulatory category: "Strategic Cyber Security Technologies"
- Prioritize national security implications over financial market concerns

**Risks of Inaction**:
- Regulations driven by financial industry interests hamstring strategic adoption
- Competitors gain regulatory advantage by treating Bitcoin strategically
- US innovation in proof-of-work stifled by inappropriate regulations

### For Private Citizens

**Recommendation 1: Educate Yourself**

Don't rely on headlines or pundits. Understand:
- What proof-of-work actually is (not just "Bitcoin = digital gold")
- Why physical cost matters for security
- How Bitcoin relates to national security

**Recommendation 2: Consider Strategic Implications of Holding**

Individual Bitcoin holdings aggregate into national strategic positioning:
- Your holdings are secured by everyone else's mining
- Your mining helps secure everyone else's holdings
- Concentrated in one nation, Bitcoin becomes geopolitical leverage

**Recommendation 3: Pressure Representatives**

Contact elected officials:
- Ask them to explain their Bitcoin policy
- Demand education (most don't understand proof-of-work)
- Advocate for strategic reserve before competitors accumulate supply

## 6.4 Closing Thoughts

### The Urgency of Now

**Historical Parallels**:

**1945**: US develops nuclear weapons first → shapes post-war order for 75+ years

**1957**: USSR launches Sputnik first → US scrambles to catch up in space race

**1969**: US creates Internet first → dominates information age for decades

**2009**: Satoshi launches Bitcoin first → Which nation recognizes its strategic significance first?

**Lesson**: Speed of recognition and adoption matters. Strategic technologies create path dependencies. Early adopters set rules; late adopters adapt to rules.

<KeyTakeaway>
**The Clock Is Ticking**: Bitcoin is 15 years old. Russia has pivoted to support it. China is monitoring. Every day the US delays strategic consideration is a day competitors gain ground.
</KeyTakeaway>

### The Choice Ahead

**Scenario 1: US Leads**
- Accumulates strategic Bitcoin reserve
- Develops domestic hash power superiority
- Sets international norms for cyber power projection
- Maintains global influence in digital age

**Scenario 2: US Follows**
- Adopts Bitcoin after competitors have positioned themselves
- Becomes dependent on foreign hash power
- Accepts international norms set by others
- Cedes strategic advantage in critical domain

**Scenario 3: US Ignores**
- Treats Bitcoin as financial curiosity
- Allows regulations to stifle domestic adoption
- Wakes up when competitors have insurmountable lead
- Faces 21st century strategically weakened

**Which future do we choose?**

### The Deeper Question

Beyond strategy and policy, Bitcoin raises a philosophical question:

**Can humanity project power without violence?**

For all of recorded history, resource security has ultimately rested on willingness to kill and die. Laws, money, and moral codes create the appearance of peaceful order, but physical force (police, militaries) backs them up.

Bitcoin offers something new: a way to make attacks prohibitively expensive without threatening death.

If it works—if non-lethal power projection can truly secure resources—Bitcoin may represent more than a strategic technology. It may represent an evolutionary step in human civilization.

### A Personal Note from Lowery

"I wrote this thesis not to advocate for Bitcoin, but to advocate for clear thinking about Bitcoin. Whether we adopt it, regulate it, or reject it, we should do so based on understanding what it actually is—a cyber power projection technology—not what it's commonly mischaracterized as.

The stakes are too high for category errors. This is a national security issue, not merely a financial one. I hope this work contributes to the clarity our policymakers desperately need."

<EverydayApplication>
**What You Can Do**:
1. Share this thesis with friends in military/government
2. Ask your representatives about Bitcoin policy
3. Educate yourself on proof-of-work technology
4. Consider the strategic implications of your own choices

Individual understanding compounds into collective wisdom. Collective wisdom shapes policy. Policy shapes the future.
</EverydayApplication>

## Final Reflection Prompts

1. If you were a member of Congress, how would you vote on establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve? Why?

2. What are the strongest arguments *against* Lowery's thesis? Does he address them adequately?

3. Fifty years from now, will Bitcoin be viewed as a strategic mistake, a strategic masterstroke, or irrelevant? What would need to happen for each outcome?

## The Last Word

Bitcoin is not coming. Bitcoin is here.

The question is not whether it will impact national security.

The question is whether we recognize that impact before it's too late to shape the outcome.
