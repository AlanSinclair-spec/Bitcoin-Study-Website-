# Introduction to Bitcoin

## What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is digital money that works without banks or governments controlling it. Instead of being issued by a central authority, Bitcoin runs on a network of computers around the world that work together to keep track of who owns what.

Think of it like email for money: you can send value directly to anyone, anywhere, without needing permission from a middleman. Bitcoin exists only in digital form—there are no physical coins or bills.

## The Story of Satoshi Nakamoto

In October 2008, someone using the name Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper describing Bitcoin. In January 2009, they released the first Bitcoin software and mined the first block of Bitcoin (called the "genesis block").

To this day, nobody knows who Satoshi really is—it could be one person or a group. In 2011, Satoshi disappeared from public view, leaving Bitcoin to develop on its own. This mysterious origin actually strengthens Bitcoin's core principle: no single person controls it.

<KeyTakeaway>
**Satoshi's Identity**: The mystery of who created Bitcoin isn't a bug—it's a feature. With no founder to pressure or corrupt, Bitcoin remains truly decentralized.

## Why People Use Bitcoin

### 1. Financial Freedom
You control your own money completely. No bank can freeze your account or deny you access.

### 2. Borderless Transactions
Send money to anyone worldwide without dealing with currency exchanges or international wire fees.

### 3. Limited Supply
Only 21 million Bitcoin will ever exist. Unlike government currencies that can be printed endlessly, Bitcoin has a fixed cap.

### 4. Privacy Options
While Bitcoin transactions are public, your identity doesn't have to be directly tied to them.

### 5. Protection from Inflation
Because the supply is fixed, Bitcoin can't be devalued by printing more units.

## How Bitcoin Differs from Normal Money

| Aspect | Traditional Money | Bitcoin |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| **Who Controls It** | Central banks, governments | No single controller—distributed network |
| **Supply** | Can be printed at will | Fixed at 21 million coins |
| **Transactions** | Require banks/intermediaries | Direct peer-to-peer |
| **Transparency** | Private ledgers | Public transaction ledger |
| **Access** | Requires bank account | Anyone with internet |
| **Borders** | National currencies | Global, borderless |

## The Core Idea: Decentralization

Decentralization means no single person, company, or government controls Bitcoin. Instead:

- **Thousands of computers** (called nodes) each keep a full copy of all Bitcoin transactions
- **Rules are enforced by math** and code, not by authorities
- **Changes require consensus** from the majority of the network
- **No one can print more Bitcoin** or reverse transactions they don't like

### Why Decentralization Matters

In 2013, Cyprus banks froze accounts and took depositors' money to bail out the financial system. With Bitcoin, this couldn't happen—you truly own your coins.

In countries with hyperinflation like Venezuela or Zimbabwe, local currency can lose value overnight. Bitcoin gives people an alternative that governments can't devalue.

<EverydayApplication>
**Everyday Meaning**: Decentralization means your financial power doesn't depend on trusting banks, politicians, or corporations. You can participate in the global economy from anywhere, with just an internet connection.

## Compare to Softwar Concepts

The Softwar thesis argues that Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work creates "physical costs" in cyberspace, making it strategically significant. Understanding basic decentralization is the foundation for grasping these deeper strategic ideas:

- **Softwar Focus**: Bitcoin as power projection and national security tool
- **Fundamentals Focus**: Bitcoin as money and financial freedom tool
- **Connection**: Both rely on the same core property—no central point of failure or control

## Key Takeaways

1. **Bitcoin is digital money** that works without banks or governments
2. **Satoshi Nakamoto** created Bitcoin in 2009 and then disappeared
3. **Decentralization** means no single entity controls the network
4. **21 million limit** prevents inflation through printing money
5. **Anyone with internet** can use Bitcoin regardless of location or status

## Everyday Application

**This Week**: Notice when you need permission to use money (bank hours, transaction limits, international fees). Ask yourself: "Would Bitcoin solve this friction?"

**Thought Exercise**: If you could send $100 to a friend in another country instantly for pennies in fees, how would that change your relationships or opportunities?

## Reflect

1. What does "being your own bank" mean to you? What responsibilities would that involve?

2. Think of a time when a financial institution limited your freedom (denied a transaction, froze funds, high fees). How would decentralization have changed that experience?
