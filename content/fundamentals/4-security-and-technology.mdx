# Security and Technology

## Private and Public Keys

Bitcoin security relies on **cryptography**—mathematical locks that only you can open.

### Your Public Key (Address)
- Like your email address or bank account number
- Safe to share publicly
- Others use it to send you Bitcoin

### Your Private Key
- Like your email password or bank PIN
- **Never share this with anyone**
- Gives complete control over your Bitcoin

<KeyTakeaway>
**"Not your keys, not your coins"**: If someone else (like an exchange) holds your private keys, they control your Bitcoin. True ownership means holding your own keys.
</KeyTakeaway>

## How Bitcoin Stays Secure

1. **Cryptographic Signatures**: Your private key creates a unique signature for each transaction that proves you authorized it
2. **Hash Functions**: One-way math that makes tampering detectable
3. **Network Consensus**: Thousands of nodes validate every transaction
4. **Proof-of-Work**: Massive computational effort required to attack

**Cost to Attack**: You'd need to control 51% of all mining power globally—estimated at billions of dollars in hardware and electricity per hour.

## The Double-Spending Problem

Before Bitcoin, digital money had a fatal flaw: **copying**. If money is just data, can't you copy-paste it and spend twice?

**Bitcoin's Solution**:
1. Every transaction is broadcast to the whole network
2. Miners include transactions in blocks
3. The blockchain records which coins moved where
4. Trying to spend the same coin twice gets rejected by nodes

This is Bitcoin's core innovation: solving double-spending without a central authority.

## Losing Access to Wallets

**If you lose your private keys, your Bitcoin is gone forever.** No one can recover it—not Bitcoin developers, not miners, nobody.

### Best Practices

1. **Write down your seed phrase** (12-24 words) on paper
2. **Store multiple copies** in secure locations (safe, bank vault)
3. **Never store digitally** (no photos, no cloud storage)
4. **Test your backup** by restoring to a new wallet

<EverydayApplication>
**Responsibility Trade-off**: You gain complete control but accept complete responsibility. It's like being handed a briefcase of cash—ultimate freedom, ultimate accountability.
</EverydayApplication>

## Energy Use and Environmental Debates

Bitcoin uses approximately 0.5% of global electricity—comparable to all data centers or Christmas lights worldwide.

### The Environmental Concern
Critics argue Bitcoin's energy use contributes to climate change and is wasteful.

### The Counterarguments
1. **Security Requires Energy**: The energy isn't wasted—it's the cost of securing a global, permissionless monetary system
2. **Renewable Mining**: ~60% of Bitcoin mining uses renewable energy (hydro, solar, wind)
3. **Stranded Energy**: Miners utilize energy that would otherwise be wasted (flared gas, excess hydro)
4. **Banking Comparison**: Traditional banking's total energy use (buildings, ATMs, armored cars, servers) exceeds Bitcoin's

### The Data Gap
We lack precise data for either system's full environmental impact, making definitive comparisons difficult.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Private keys** give complete control; lose them and lose your Bitcoin
2. **Public keys** are safe to share for receiving Bitcoin
3. **Double-spending** is prevented by network consensus and Proof-of-Work
4. **Energy debate** has valid points on both sides; data is incomplete
5. **Self-custody** means you are your own bank—with all the responsibility

## Everyday Application

**This Week**: Practice the security model with a test wallet and tiny amount ($5). Write down seed phrase, delete wallet, restore from seed phrase. This builds confidence.

## Reflect

1. What's one digital account where you wish you had full control without relying on a company? Could Bitcoin's key model apply?

2. Is the energy trade-off worth it? Under what conditions would you say yes or no?

## Glossary Terms

- **Private Key**: Secret code that controls your Bitcoin
- **Public Key**: Address others use to send you Bitcoin
- **Double-Spending**: Fraudulently spending the same coin twice
- **Cold Wallet**: Offline storage device for maximum security
- **Hash**: One-way cryptographic function used throughout Bitcoin
