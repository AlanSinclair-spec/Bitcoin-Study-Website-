## ✅ Personal Application Journal

### Data Models & Storage

**TypeScript Interfaces** (`/lib/journal/types.ts`):
```typescript
- JournalEntry: id, title, contentMD, tags, links, habits, rating, weekOf
- Goal: id, title, description, targetDate, status
- Habit: id, label, cadence (daily/weekly), active
- JournalStats: entries, streaks, confidence, completion rates
```

**Storage Layer** (`/lib/journal/storage.ts`):
- `LocalJournalStorage` class with localStorage persistence
- CRUD operations for entries, goals, habits
- Export/import functionality (JSON)
- Sync-enabled flag for future Prisma integration
- Browser-only (SSR-safe with typeof window checks)

### Reflection Prompts

**30 Total Prompts** (`/lib/journal/prompts.ts`):
- 10 Bitcoin Fundamentals prompts (decentralization, security, economics)
- 10 Softwar prompts (power projection, policy, strategy)
- 10 General prompts (learning, teaching, action planning)
- Each tagged by category and linked concepts
- Insertable into journal entries with one click

**Default Habits** (5 pre-configured):
- Review seed phrase storage (weekly)

## 📊 Statistics

### Content Volume

**Bitcoin Fundamentals**:
- 6 lessons (~15,000 words total)
- 25 flashcards
- 17 quiz questions (15 MCQ + 2 short-answer)
- 30+ glossary terms defined inline
- 12 "Reflect" prompts embedded

**Personal Journal**:
- 30 reflection prompts (categorized)
- 5 default habits
- 3 starter goals
- 4 major UI components (dashboard, composer, detail, settings)

### Code Files Created

**Fundamentals**:
- 6 MDX lesson files (`/content/fundamentals/`)
- 2 JSON data files (`/data/fundamentals/`)
- 2 route pages (`/app/fundamentals/`)

**Journal**:
- 3 TypeScript libraries (`/lib/journal/`)
- 4 route pages (`/app/journal/`)
- Data models and storage abstraction

**Total**: ~20 new files, ~3,000 lines of code

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### MDX Components

Custom components for Fundamentals lessons:
```jsx
<KeyTakeaway>        // Blue-highlighted boxes for main ideas
<EverydayApplication> // Green boxes for practical application
```

Both render with special styling and are reusable across all lessons.

### Storage Architecture

**Layered Design**:
1. TypeScript interfaces define shapes
2. `LocalJournalStorage` class abstracts persistence
3. Components consume via async methods
4. Future: swap in `PrismaJournalStorage` without changing components

**Why Local-First**:
- Instant writes (no network lag)
- Works offline
- No backend required initially
- User controls their data (export anytime)

### Week-Based Grouping

Journal entries grouped by "week of" (Monday start):
```typescript
const weekStart = new Date(now);
weekStart.setDate(now.getDate() - now.getDay());
```

This enables:
- Weekly review view on dashboard
- Consistent habit tracking cadence
- Natural reflection rhythm
